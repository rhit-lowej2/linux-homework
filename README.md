### Repository Index:
generate-dataset.sh - A bash script for creating (int32, int32, ascii100) data records of variable size. It records the execution time in nohup.out and continues even if the user logs out.

sort-data.sh - A bash script for sorting data records generated by generate-dataset.sh. It sorts by the first column and outputs the execution time.

visualize-times.py - A python script that uses matplotlib to generate a graph of generation and sorting times. I didn't think we had to automate the collection of the time data so it is currently hard-coded in the script.

### Example Usage (note: must use bash, doesn't work with sh):
bash generate-dataset.sh filename.txt 1000 - creates a file with 1000 records in it

bash sort-data.sh filename.txt sorted.txt - sorts filename by first column and outputs the result to sorted.txt

python3 visualize-times.py - creates a graph with the times recorded
